# Sinatra Word List

A Sinatra app that keeps track of words and their meanings. New words are appended to a text file. Then each line is read back and shown on the page.

I try to make note of unfamiliar words and this app will serve as a way to keep track. 📝

## Installation

Use the <span style="color:red">Ruby</span> dependency management tool [Bundler](https://bundler.io) to install everything.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wilsjame/sinatra-word-list.git
cd sinatra-word-list
bundle install
```

## Usage

Work in progress so run a local development server.

```bash
bundle exec rackup
```
